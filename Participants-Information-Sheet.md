Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part in this research.  It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.

**What is the research about?**
This is a research project in collaboration of the University of Southampton, UK and Saint-Etienne, France, funded by the European Union in the WDAqua project. We are PhD students interested in improving accessibility of information in Wikipedia. The objective of our research is to evaluate automatically generated text based on data in Wikidata, which is supposed to resemble text written by a Wikipedia editor in their respective language. Our study has undergone ethical review by the University of Southampton.

**Why have I been asked to participate?**
We are approaching people fluent in either Esperanto or Arabic in general as well as Wikipedia editors in order to gain an insight of whether our generated text fulfills quality standards as well being helpful for underserved language communities. 

**What will happen to me if I take part?**
This study will be evaluated anonymously, meaning none of the information can be connected to one user. We expect the full survey to take about 30 - 40 minutes of your time. However, at any time, you can quit the survey, we will keep the results filed until this point. You can also save your results and come back any time until the 25/10/2017 to finish the survey. You will read sentences, evaluate their quality and how appropriate they fit into Wikipedia. Additionally, we might ask you later to write something in Esperanto or Arabic, respectively. There is no mandatory part of this survey, but we would like to ask you kindly to respond to all questions, if possible.

**Are there any benefits in my taking part?**
Your participation will be of great help to understand language generated for underserved communities. We will be able to understand, where to improve and how to enable a system providing access to missing information. Therefore, we would like to thank every contributor for making a way for potential monolingual speakers, that wouldn’t be able to access the information otherwise. 

**Are there any risks involved?**
This survey does not involve any risks for the participants. 

**Will my participation be confidential?**
To the best of our knowledge, every part of this survey will be anonymized, and can not be tracked to an individual participant. We comply with the Data Protection Act and our University’s policy regarding confidentiality. Access to the data in this study will only be given to the involved students as well as their supervisors in the respective universities. 

**What happens if I change my mind?**
A randomly assigned participant number is shown in the survey and based on this number you can withdraw your answers.

**What will happen to the results of the research?**
The results of the research will be analyzed in order to evaluate our approach for generating text in underserved languages. We are planning to publish the results to a computer science conference in the form of a research paper. Anonymized data will be accessible after the study finished and we published the results. We are aiming to publish our paper as Open Access, therefore the research will be accessible to anyone. Any texts produced as part of this study will be copyrighted under CC0, but not published as of now.
